Line Drawing Algorithm with OpenGL
========================================

I implement two line drawing algorithm functions: Basic Line Drawing algorithm and Bresenham’s Line Drawing algorithm.

The Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm is just a little bit more faster than the Basic Line Drawing Algorithm. But when drawing a large number lines, the Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm is much more faster than Basic Line Drawing Algorithm. Because the Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm are dealing with integer numbers, no round operation, no multiplication, just shift. The time for drawing a solid line and dashed line are similar.
